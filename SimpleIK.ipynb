    "I've recently become interested in inverse kinematics. I last flirted with it when I was in undergrad, where I [built a simple hexapod and implemented its IK](https://www.gauravmanek.com/blog/2015/hexapod-step-planner/), but that was a long time ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "My renewed interest comes from acquiring a [cheap SO101 robot arm](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/so101) for work and by watching videos of the [da Vinci surgery robot](https://www.intuitive.com/en-us/products-and-services/da-vinci) at work. Eventually, I'd like to work up to implementing IK that works with the constraints of that system. This series will cover:\n",
